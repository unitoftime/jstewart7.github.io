      <description>Introduction Often, in 2D games we represent the world as some sort of tilemap. Usually you can think of this as just a 2D array where each entry holds a tile. When it comes time to render, you can easily draw the map by translating every tile to a sprite and drawing that sprite to the screen. The result would probably look something like this:
        Figure 1: A grid-based rendering of a tilemap    Although this is a good approach, it emphasizes the grid-based nature of the tilemap.</description>

      <description>Introduction I figured that since my name is Jacob, I better know what the Jacobian is - just in case someone asks me. I stumbled upon this YouTube video about the Jacobian today and gave it a watch. I recalled using the Jacobian back in college; but at the time, I had never invested much time into learning what it actually was. Plus this gives me a good excuse to practice my Tex math notation.</description>

      <description>Introduction This week I worked on adding a network proxy to our backend architecture. Today we will talk about what a network proxy is, why it is useful, and how we built ours.
What even is a proxy? A proxy is a service that sits in front of another computer and forwards network messages on behalf of that computer. Similar to how a proxy voter might vote on behalf of a person - a proxy server sends and receives network traffic on behalf of another server.</description>
